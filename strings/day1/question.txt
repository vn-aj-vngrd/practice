Strings:

Easy:
Question: Check if a string is a palindrome.
Follow-up: Ignore non-alphanumeric characters and check if the modified string is a palindrome.

Moderate:
Question: Determine if two strings are anagrams.
Follow-up: Implement a function to find the minimum number of changes required to make two strings anagrams.

Intermediate:
Question: Implement a basic string compression algorithm. (e.g., "aabcccccaaa" -> "a2b1c5a3")
Follow-up: If the compressed string is not smaller than the original, return the original string.

Advanced:
Question: Given a string, find the longest substring without repeating characters.
Follow-up: Optimize the solution to achieve linear time complexity.
